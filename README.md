## Introduction
PhishCatcher is a sophisticated Chrome Extension crafted to identify and obstruct phishing websites as they happen. It harnesses a machine learning model finely tuned on an extensive compilation of URLs to discern with precision if a URL harbors malicious intent. Active tab URLs are relayed to the backend API, where they undergo analysis, culminating in a prediction. Should the likelihood of a phishing threat be detected, PhishCatcher intervenes, barring access and thus shielding the user from harm.
